  <p class="custom">Brin earned his bachelor’s degree in mathematics at the University of Maryland, where his father has worked before. Soon after Sergey decided he’d need a higher education, so he pursued education at Stanford University, deciding to continue learning computer sciences. While attending Stanford University Brin met a man who would soon become one of his best friends  and someone he’d help to found a booming business with, Larry Page. According to the two, they had disagreed with each other on nearly everything, though through all this they could still find means for a friendship, they had "became intellectual soul-mates and close friends" according to sources. They had even worked on a paper together, both authoring it. The title is, "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine". 
At one point in their friendship and University days, they had taken each other’s ideas for a search engine algorithm and put them together, using Page’s dorm as a laboratory and Brin’s as a coding center and office area, they founded Google, one of the most widely used search engines in the world and a very rich industry giant in tech.</p>
